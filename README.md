Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide information on using Git for version control for a student's prediction model that aims to find the ideal number of hours a student should study to score good marks. Git is a widely used version control system that enables developers to manage changes to their code base, collaborate with others, and track the history of their project.

Step 1: Installation of Git

To use Git, you must first install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup process.

Step 2: Creating a Git Repository

Once you have installed Git, you can create a new repository. A repository is a place where you can store all the files related to your project. To create a new repository, run the following command in your terminal:

csharp
Copy code
```
$ git init 
```
Step 3: Adding Files to the Repository

Once you have created your repository, you can add your prediction model and other relevant files to the repository. To add files to your repository, you need to run the following commands:

csharp
Copy code
```
$ git add <file-name>
```
Replace <file-name> with the name of the file you want to add. You can also add all the files in your repository by running the following command:

csharp
Copy code
$ git add .
Step 4: Committing Changes

Once you have added your files to the repository, you need to commit your changes. Committing changes allows you to save your progress and create a new version of your project. To commit your changes, run the following command:

ruby
Copy code
 
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
 
The -m option is used to provide a commit message, which describes the changes you have made.

Step 5: Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

If you want to collaborate with others on your project, you can push your changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab. To push your changes to a remote repository, you need to run the following command:

perl
Copy code
$ git push origin master
Replace origin with the name of your remote repository, and master with the name of your branch.

Conclusion

This document provides a basic overview of using Git for version control for a student's prediction model. By following these steps, you can create a repository, add files, commit changes, and collaborate with others on your project. With Git, you can track the history of your project and revert to previous versions if necessary.
